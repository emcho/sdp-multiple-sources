Abstract

   Th&#1077; SDP Offer/Answer model describes a mechanism that allows
   two entities to negotiate a multimedia session.  The SDP syntax of
   the Offer/Answer model uses constructs known as media (m=) lines to
   describe each medium.  Historically implementations have most often
   used such "m=" lines as an envelope for one RTP session carrying a
   maximum of two RTP streams (SSRCs) at a time: one in each direction.
   However, RTP in general imposes no such limitation and allows for any
   number of media streams (SSRCs) to be exchanged in a single RTP
   session.

   This document explores the use of "m=" lines for the negotiation of
   sessions with multiple media sources.  It presents the advantages of
   such an approach as well as the challenges that it implies in terms
   of interoperability with already deployed legacy devices.

   The model described here was first presented in the RTCWEB No Plan
   proposal.  The reason to spin it off into this new document is mainly
   to separate the parts related to Offer/Answer and "m=" line
   semantics, from those that are specific to WebRTC.

1.  Background

   Since its early days the Offer/Answer (O/A) model [RFC3264] has
   mainly been used for the negotiation of Real-time Transport Protocol
   [RFC3550] sessions between endpoints that only use a single media
   source per medium.  Examples of such sources include microphones,
   cameras, desktop streamers etc.  The list can be extended to cases
   where multiple sources are often mixed at the media level by an audio
   or video mixer and then appear as a single stream, i.e. RTP
   Synchronisation Source (SSRC) on the RTP and Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] levels.

   In such sessions each medium and its corresponding device are
   described by the SDP "m=" line construct and each media source is
   mapped to exactly one "m=" line.  The exchanges that lead to the
   establishment of such sessions are relatively well covered by the
   specifications and most implementations.

Internet-Draft         SDP O/A with Multiple SSRCs             July 2013


   Unfortunately, [RFC3264] is relatively vague when it comes to
   scenarios involving endpoints with multiple media sources.

   At the time of writing of this document, the MMUSIC working group is
   considering two approaches to addressing the issue.  The approaches
   emerged in the RTCWEB working group and are often referred to as Plan
   A [PlanA] and Plan B [PlanB].  Both of them impose semantics and
   syntax that allow for detailed description and fine-grained control
   of multiple media sources entirely through SDP and Offer/Answer.

   Both plans A and B present a number of problems most of which are due
   to the heavy reliance on SDP O/A. The problems are discussed in more
   detail in Section 7.

   The goal of this document is to propose an alternative approach that
   views "m=" lines as descriptors of RTP sessions with any number of
   sources, keeps the use of SDP Offer/Answer to the initialization of
   transport and media chains and delegates stream control to other,
   upper layer protocols.

2.  Introduction

   The goal of this document is to describe a way of using SDP Offer/
   Answer in sessions with multiple media sources (SSRCs), that limits
   the actual number of offers and answers exchanged on the wire to a
   minimum required for transport and codec chain initialization.  The
   main point of the proposal is the fact that any "m=" line contains
   enough information for setting up RTP sessions with any number of
   SSRCs.  Many applications may find such negotiation entirely
   sufficient for their needs.

   Obviously many others need to support additional control.  Depending
   on the use case many would need to turn some SSRCs off, while keeping
   others active, match SSRCs to user identities, mute some of them,
   change their direction, orientation, visual effects, etc.  The
   variety of use cases suggests a variety of different needs and
   potentially different solutions.  While SDP Offer/Answer is likely to
   be the mechanism of choice for many, it is just as likely that it
   will not be the case for many more.

   The model described in this specification is important for
   applications with the following goals/constraints:

   o  the addition and removal of media sources (e.g. conference
      participants, multiple web cams or "slides" ) must be possible
      without the need of Offer/Answer exchanges;

Internet-Draft         SDP O/A with Multiple SSRCs             July 2013


   o  the addition or removal of simulcast or layered streams must be
      possible without the need for Offer/Answer exchanges beyond the
      initial declaration of such capabilities for either direction.

   o  call establishment must not require preliminary announcement or
      even knowledge of all potentially participating media sources;

   o  application specific signalling should be used to cover most
      semantics following call establishment, such as adding, removing
      or identifying SSRCs;

   o  straightforward interoperability with widely deployed legacy
      endpoints with rudimentary support for Offer/Answer.  This
      includes devices that allow for one audio and potentially one
      video m= line and that expect to only ever be required to render a
      single RTP stream at a time for any of them.  (Note that this does
      NOT include devices that expect to see multiple "m=video" lines
      for different SSRCs as they can hardly be viewed as "widely
      deployed legacy").

   To achieve the above requirements this specification expects that
   endpoints will only use SDP Offer/Answer to establish transport
   channels and initialize an RTP stack and codec/processing chains.
   This also includes any renegotiation that requires the re-
   initialisation of these chains.  For example, adding VP8 to a session
   that was setup with only H.264, would obviously still require an
   Offer/Answer exchange.

   All other session control and signalling are to be left to upper
   layer protocol mechanisms.

3.  Mechanism

   The model presented in this specification relies on use of standard
   SDP and Offer/Answer for negotiating formats, establishing transport
   channels and exchanging, in a declarative way, media and transport
   parameters that are then used for the initialization of the
   corresponding stacks.

   The following is an example presenting what this specification views
   as a typical offer sent by a multistream endpoint following this
   specification:

   The most important aspects in the above exchange are:

   o  Preserves interoperability with most kinds of legacy endpoints.

   o  Allows the negotiation of most parameters that concern the media/
      RTP stack (typically the browser).

   o  Only a single Offer/Answer exchange is required for session
      establishment and, in most cases, for the entire duration of a
      session.

   o  Leaves complete freedom to applications as to the way that they
      are going to signal any other information such as SSRC
      identification information or the addition or removal of RTP
      streams.

3.1.  Discovery

   It is important that an implementation using "m=" lines as an
   envelope for multiple RTP media streams, be able to reliably detect
   whether its peer is capable of receiving them.  One way of achieving
   this would be the use of upper-layer protocols as explained in
   Section 4.

   In cases where endpoints need to be able to detect this from the SDP
   Offer/Answer they could use the "max-send-ssrc" and "max-recv-ssrc"
   attributes defined in [MAX-SSRC].  It has to be noted however that
   this mechanism is still a work in progress and as such it would still
   need to be extended to provide ways of distinguishing between
   independent flows and complementary ones such as layered FEC and RTX.

   Unless an endpoint detects the corresponding max-ssrc or upper level
   protocol indicators that a remote peer can actually handle multiple
   streams within a single "m=" line, it MUST assume that such support
   is unavailable.

4.  Additional Session Control and Signalling

   o  Adding and removing RTP streams to an existing session.

   o  Accepting and refusing some of them.

   o  Identifying SSRCs and obtaining additional metadata for them (e.g.
      the user corresponding to a specific SSRC).

   o  Requesting that additional SSRCs be added.

   o  Requesting that specific processing be applied on some SSRCs.

   Support for any subset of the above semantics is highly dependent on
   the use cases and applications where they are employed.  The position
   of this specification is that they should therefore be left to
   protocols that target more specific scenarios.  There are numerous
   existing or emerging solutions, some of them developed by the IETF,
   that already cover this.  This includes CLUE channels [CLUE], the SIP
   Event Package For Conference State [RFC4575] and its XMPP variant
   [COIN] as well as the protocols defined within the Centralised
   Conferencing IETF working group [XCON] . Additional mechanisms,
   undoubtedly many based on JSON, are very likely to emerge in the
   future as WebRTC applications address varying use cases, scenarios
   and topologies.

   The most important part of this specification is hence to prevent
   certain assumptions or topologies from being imposed on applications.
   One example of this is the need to know and include in the Offer/
   Answer exchange, all the SSRCs that can show up in a session.  This
   can be particularly problematic for scenarios that involve endpoints
   with varying constraints.

   Large scale conference calls, potentially federated through RTP
   translator-like bridges, would be another problematic scenario.
   Being able to always pre-announce SSRCs in such situations could of
   course be made to work but it would come at a price.  It would either
   require a very high number of Offer/Answer updates that propagate the
   information through the entire topology, or use of tricks such as
   pre-allocating a range of "fake" SSRCs, announcing them to
   participants and then overwriting the actual SSRCs with them.
   Depending on the scenario both options could prove inappropriate or
   inefficient while some applications may not even need such
   information.  Others could be retrieving it through simplistic means
   such as access to a centralized resource (e.g. an URL pointing to a
   JSON description of the conference).

5.  Demultiplexing and Identifying Streams (Use of Bundle)

   For reasons of optimising traversal of Network Address Translation
   (NAT) gateways, it is likely for endpoints to use [BUNDLE].  This
   implies that all RTP streams would in many cases end up being
   received on the same port.  A demuxing mechanism is therefore
   necessary in order for these packets to then be fed into the
   appropriate processing chain (i.e. matched to an m= line).

Internet-Draft         SDP O/A with Multiple SSRCs             July 2013


      Note: it is important to distinguish between the demultiplexing
      and the identification of incoming flows.  Throughout this
      specification the former is used to refer to the process of
      choosing selecting a depacketizing/decoding/processing chain to
      feed incoming packets to.  Such decisions depend solely on the
      format that is used to encode the content of incoming packets.

      The above is not to be confused with the process of making
      rendering decision about a processed flow.  Such decisions include
      showing a "current speaker" flow at a specific location, window or
      video tag, while choosing a different one for a second, "slides"
      flow.  Another example would be the possibility to attach "Alice",
      "Bob" and "Carol" labels on top of the appropriate UI components.
      This specification leaves such rendering choices entirely to
      application-specific signalling as described in Section 4.

   This specification uses demuxing based on RTP payload types.  When
   creating offers and answers WebRTC applications MUST therefore
   allocate RTP payload types only once per bundle group.  In cases
   where rtcp-mux is in use this would mean a maximum of 96 payload
   types per bundle [RFC5761].  It has been pointed out that some legacy
   devices may have unpredictable behaviour with payload types that are
   outside the 96-127 range reserved by [RFC3551] for dynamic use.  Some
   applications or implementations may therefore choose not to use
   values outside this range.  Whatever the reason, offerers that find
   they need more than the available payload type numbers, will simply
   need to either use a second bundle group or not use BUNDLE at all
   (which in the case of a single audio and a single video m= line
   amounts to roughly the same thing).  This would also imply building a
   dynamic table, mapping SSRCs to PTs and m= lines, in order to then
   also allow for RTCP demuxing.

   While not desirable, the implications of such a decision would be
   relatively limited.  Use of trickle ICE [TRICKLE-ICE] is going to
   lessen the impact on call establishment latency.  Also, the fact that
   this would only occur in a limited number of cases makes it unlikely
   to have a significant effect on port consumption.

   An additional requirement that has been expressed toward demuxing is
   the ability to assign incoming packets with the same payload type to
   different processing chains depending on their SSRCs.  A possible
   example for this is a scenario where two video streams are being
   rendered on different video screens that each have their own decoding
   hardware.

   While the above may appear as a demuxing and a decoding related
   problem it is really mostly a rendering policy specific to an
   application.  As such it should be handled by app. specific

   signalling that could involve custom-formatted, per-SSRC information
   that accompanies SDP offers and answers.

6.  Simulcasting, FEC, Layering and RTX (Open Issue)

   From a WebRTC perspective, repair flows such as layering, FEC, RTX
   and to some extent simulcasting, present an interesting challenge,
   which is why they are considered an open issue by this specification.

   On the one hand they are transport utilities that need to be
   understood, supported and used by browsers in a way that is mostly
   transparent to applications.  On the other, some applications may
   need to be made aware of them and given the option to control their
   use.  This could be necessary in cases where their use needs to be
   signalled to non-WebRTC endpoints in an application specific way.
   Another example is the possibility for an application to choose to
   disable some or all repair flows because it has been made aware by
   application-specific signalling that they are temporarily not being
   used/rendered by the remote end (e.g. because it is only displaying a
   thumbnail or because a corresponding video tag is not currently
   visible).

   One way of handling such flows would be to advertise them in the way
   suggested by [RFC5956] and to then control them through application
   specific signalling.  This options has the merit of already existing
   but it also implies the pre-announcement and propagation of SSRCs and
   the bloated signalling that this incurs.  Also, relying solely on
   Offer/Answer here would expose an offerer to the typical race
   condition of repair SSRCs arriving before the answer and the
   processing ambiguity that this would imply.

   Another approach could be a combination of RTCP and RTP header
   extensions [RFC5285] in a way similar to the one employed by the
   Rapid Synchronisation of RTP Flows [RFC6051].  While such a mechanism
   is not currently defined by the IETF, specifying it could be
   relatively straightforward:

   Every packet belonging to a repair flow could carry an RTP header
   extension [RFC5285] that points to the source stream (or source layer
   in case of layered mechanisms).

   Again, these are just some possibilities.  Different mechanisms may
   and probably will require different extensions or signalling
   ([SRCNAME] will likely be an option for some).  In some cases, where
   layering information is provided by the codec, an extensions is not
   going to be necessary at all.

   by the recipient, this information could also be delayed until the
   reception of the first RTCP packet.

7.  Comparison with Plans A and B

   As already mentioned both Plans A and B heavily rely on SDP and Offer
   /Answer for advanced stream control.  They both require Offer/Answer
   exchanges in a number of situations where this could be avoided,
   particularly when adding or removing media sources to a session.
   This requirement applies equally to cases where a client adds the
   stream of a newly activated web cam, a simulcast flow or upon the
   arrival or departure of a conference participant.

   Plan A handles such notifications with the addition or removal of
   independent m= lines [PlanA], while Plan B relies on the use of
   multiplexed m= lines but still depends on the Offer/Answer exchanges
   for the addition or removal of media stream identifiers [MSID].

   By taking the Offer/Answer approach, both Plan A and Plan B take away
   from the application the opportunity to handle such events in a way
   that is most fitting for the use case, which, among other things,
   also goes against the working group's decision to not to define a
   specific signalling protocol.  (It could be argued that it is
   therefore only natural how proponents of each plan, having different
   use cases in mind, are remarkably far from reaching consensus).

   Reliance on preliminary announcement of SSRC identifiers is another
   issue.  While this could be perceived as relatively straightforward
   in one-to-one sessions or even conference calls within controlled
   environments, it can be a problem in the following cases:

   o  interoperability with legacy endpoints

   o  use within non-controlled and potentially federated conference
      environments where new RTP streams may appear relatively often.
      In such cases the signalling required to describe all of them
      through Offer/Answer may represent substantial overhead while none
      or only a part of it (e.g.  the description of a main, active
      speaker stream) may be required by the application.

   By increasing the number of Offer/Answer exchanges Both Plan A and
   Plan B also increase the risk of encountering glare situations (i.e.
   cases where both parties attempt to modify a session at the same
   time).  While glare is also possible with basic Offer/Answer and
   resolution of such situations must be implemented anyway, the need to
   frequently resort to such code may either negatively impact user
   experience (e.g. when "back off" resolution is used) or require
